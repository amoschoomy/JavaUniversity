Task 4

I chose String type for the student ID over int type.

Advantages and Disadvantages of choosing String over int type

Disadvantages: int data type have better performance than String. This makes the system's runtime to be faster in a real
world situation.

Errors in the student ID can also be detected in compile time making it easier to detect any abnormality if the student
ID is has a different format


Advantages:

If String type is used, then the studentID can be of any format including various combinations of alphabets and numbers
This allows for more flexible unique studentIDs.
Example University A student ID could be just integers but University B can use a alphanumeric  characters such as
A20C17

Another possible disadvantages of int data type is there is only a fixed number of int value of 32 bit. Even though in
real life, this 32bit limit is unlikely to be reached but it presents


A reason on why we use givenName and familyName is because of different naming conventions around the world.
Programmers importing our project will be confused if firstName and lastName is used instead

Task 5

I chose ArrayList over Array because ArrayList size is dynamic. The number of students in University is also dynamic
since it is always changing.



WEEK 4 TASK 1 JUSTIFICATION


I chose HashSet because it can access studentIDs in O(1) time without transversing through HashSet. Since the order of
 student ID is not important, TreeSet is unnecessary here. As we know, studentIDs are unique and no duplicates,
 hashSet also does not allow duplicates.
